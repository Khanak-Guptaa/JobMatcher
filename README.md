# JobMatcher

JobMatcher is a team project developed during **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** with the goal of matching candidates to relevant jobs or internships using data-driven and machine learning–based techniques.

## Problem Statement
Finding relevant job and internship opportunities can be time-consuming and inefficient due to skill mismatches and unstructured data. JobMatcher aims to improve this process by using similarity-based matching between candidate profiles and job requirements.

## Approach
- Preprocessed candidate and job data for consistency
- Generated vector representations (embeddings) of skills and job descriptions
- Applied similarity-based ranking to match candidates with suitable roles
- Evaluated results using sample datasets

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning Embeddings
- Git & GitHub

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and model logic
- `data/` – Datasets used for testing and evaluation
- `embeddings/` – Generated vector representations

## Note
This repository represents a hackathon prototype and focuses on demonstrating the core idea and workflow.
